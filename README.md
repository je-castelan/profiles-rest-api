Profiles Rest API project
=========================

By: Jose Emanuel Castelan

Using the [Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django - Beginner](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python/)'s course, I'm making a REST API  with the enough elements to manage profiles with a bakced using Django Rest Framework.

You can see the notes about this course [here](Notes.md).

Also, you can look the project scope on this course [here](Scope.md).

You can fin my final api on AWS server [here](http://ec2-18-220-227-177.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/first_api/).
